# pc-build-assembly-troubleshooting
A hands-on project documenting the process of assembling, configuring, troubleshooting, and optimizing a custom desktop PC. This includes cable management, hardware installation, BIOS/UEFI configuration, driver setup, operating system installation, and performance tuning.

## **Project Overview**

In this project, I fully assembled and configured a custom desktop PC from an empty case. This lab involved hardware installation, system wiring, BIOS/UEFI configuration, operating system setup, and performance testing. Throughout the build, I identified and resolved hardware conflicts, validated system stability, and fine-tuned settings to ensure optimal operation. This project demonstrates hands-on technical ability with computer hardware, diagnostics, and system optimization.

## **Key Activities Completed**

- Installed and assembled major components (including installing the CPU, CPU fan, RAM, M.2 NVMe SSD, and Radeon GPU)
- Connected and routed all power and data cables
- Configured the BIOS/UEFI
- Validated hardware compatibility
- Installed the operating system
- Troubleshot system errors
- Conducted performance checks
